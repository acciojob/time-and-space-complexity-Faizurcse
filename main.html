	<h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It serves as a crucial metric for evaluating and comparing the efficiency of different algorithms in solving specific computational problems. efficient algorithm exhibits lower time complexity, indicating that it can handle larger inputs with fewer computational resources and in less time. </p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another vital metric in computer science that evaluates the amount of memory or storage space an algorithm requires relative to the size of its input. It is crucial for understanding and managing the resource consumption of algorithms, especially in environments with limited memory. O(n) (pronounced "big O of n") is a common way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's space complexity. In this notation, 'n' represents the size of the input data. When an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the amount of memory it requires grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
